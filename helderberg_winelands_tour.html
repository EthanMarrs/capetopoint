                Join this tour to experience the rich cultural heritage of a unique Boland wine producing area, while
                tasting premium wines, olives, cheese and more.
                This tour includes a memorable visit to the internationally acclaimed Vergelegen Wine Estate, where you
                will view a classic Cape Dutch homestead and out buildings where slaves once lived, surrounded by 300
                year-old Camphor and old Yellowwood trees.
                Travel along the scenic Indian Ocean route via the university town of Stellenbosch before entering the
                Helderberg region, and Somerset West. This tour of three award winning wine estates provides visitors
                with magnificent scenery and historic insight of how wine and agriculture first came into being in this
                region, as far back as the 1700’s.
                As an original Cape settler destination, like most of the oldest wine producing regions of the Cape, it
                comprises pockets of land originally distributed to Cape Dutch Settlers by the Governor of the Cape at
                the time, Simon van der Stel. Explore his discovery of the agricultural riches and superior wine terroir
                of the Helderberg and Schaapenberg Mountains. Find out more about the viticulture and botany history of
                this region, since the arrival of the 1820 settlers, who came in search of a better life in the fairest
                Cape. View the work of master architects, artisans and cellar masters whose Cape Dutch traditions
                remain carefully preserved for future generations.
                Return along the N2 freeway, past Langa and Guguletu townships, the University of Cape Town, and Ou
                Kaapse Weg for views of the Cape Floral Kingdom. Your return may take you past the Constantia wine
                valley, Hout Bay and Chapmans Peak Drive.
