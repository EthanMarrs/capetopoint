            <p>
                Discover three prime historic wine estates of Somerset West, located less than one hour away from the
                city of Cape Town. This original Cape settler destination is one of the oldest wine producing regions of
                the Cape. Like many other winelands regions of the Cape, this land formed part of various pockets of
                lands that was distributed to the earliest Cape Dutch to the Western Cape. The Governor of the Cape at
                the time, Simon van der Stel made his mark in this region after his discovery of the ideal agricultural
                value and superior wine terroir of the Helderberg and Schaapenberg Mountains.
