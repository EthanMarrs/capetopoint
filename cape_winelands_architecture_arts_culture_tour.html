                    The distinctive white washed walls and Cape Dutch gables and roofs topped with thatch out of reed
                    was known as the Cape Dutch style of architecture. Many examples can be seen throughout the Boland
                    winelands regions, that today tells the story of beauty, functionality and heritage of the earliest
                    settlers to the country. Much of the work of the newly arrived settlers from Dutch, German, French
                    and Indonesian origins, who firmly placed their stamp of creativity and pragmatism of the unique
                    Cape Dutch Style of Architecture on the Cape, remains preserved for future generations by a number
                    of heritage councils, nationally.
