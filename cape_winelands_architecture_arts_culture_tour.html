            <p>
                This tour caters for lovers of historic buildings, art, architecture and cultural history set in the
                beauty of the Cape winelands. Visit two wine regions as listed below and three to four different estates
                to view homesteads, cellars, distilleries, and gardens. This region stretches from Constantia in the
                South Peninsula, just 20 minutes from Cape Town and Simonstown, through to the Boland regions of
                Stellenbosch, Franschhoek, Paarl, and Somerset West.
                Take a step back into history to view the picturesque landscapes where classic structures were designed
                and built in the Boland’s oldest wine villages. Find out more about the epitome of status that was
                associated with historic vineyard ownership and wine production of people of high standing.
                Many examples of the distinctive white washed walls and variety of Cape Dutch gables and roofs topped
                with thatch out of reed, known as the Cape Dutch style of architecture, tells the story of beauty,
                functionality and heritage of the earliest settlers to the country. Much of the creativity and
                pragmatism visible in the work of the 1820 settlers from Dutch, German, French and Indonesian origins,
                remains well preserved for future generations by heritage councils, nationally.

                View the tapestries of ancient artistic traditions, interwoven with practical approaches of some master
                builders of yesteryear. Enjoy anecdotal tales of the lifestyles of winemakers, farmers and families and
                successive property owners of private, state and missionary land. View their choices of decorative art,
                and Cape Dutch neoclassical, Georgian and Victorian styles of architecture that reveal purpose,
                sustainability and beauty.
                Follow the traces of the Cape Governor of the time, Simon van der Stel, who together with designers and
                artisans helped create lasting impressions of the Cape’s foreign traditions and cultures since 1679.

                    furrows and wide pavements. Discover the heritage value of preserved Cape Dutch gables and
                    buildings, and skilled work of architects, timber and steel artisans of the day. Enjoy the

                <p>
                    Find out why the foreign settlers to this town named their destination Paarl. Translated to English,
                    it means ‘pearl’, an association with the beautiful Paarl mountains, and according to some
                    historians the apt description of a precious homecoming to foreign land. Visit some of the

                <p>
                    Visit the earliest stamping grounds of Cape Dutch settlers at the historic farm named Vergelegen,
                    meaning ‘far away’. This estate, that is located at the foot of the Helderberg Mountains offers
                    panoramic views across the Indian Ocean to the Strand and Gordons Bay. It holds a rich history
                    dating from 1685 to 1706, where visitors can enjoy a valuable collection of historic traditions
                    upheld by the earliest settlers to the Cape. View some of the oldest Camphor and Yellowwood trees in
                    the country, the resident slave site, and 18 different gardens. A tour through this old homestead
                    and outbuildings is an enriching experience for lovers of art and architecture, history, and
